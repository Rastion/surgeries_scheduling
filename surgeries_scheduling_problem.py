    Surgeries Scheduling Problem

    A hospital has a fixed number of operating rooms and nurses, and a set of surgeries to be scheduled.
    Each surgery s must be scheduled within a given time window [min_start[s], max_end[s]] and takes a fixed
    duration (duration[s]). It also requires a given number of nurses (needed_nurses[s]). Each nurse n has a
    shift defined by an earliest start (shift_earliest_start[n]), a latest end (shift_latest_end[n]), and a maximum
    shift duration (max_shift_duration). Furthermore, each surgery s has a set of incompatible rooms: if
    incompatible_rooms[s][r] is 1, then surgery s cannot be performed in room r.

    A candidate solution is represented as a dictionary with:
      - "surgery_room": a list of room assignments (one per surgery).
      - "surgery_start": a list of start times (in minutes) for each surgery.
      - "surgery_end": a list of end times (in minutes) for each surgery.
      - "nurse_assignment": a list (one per nurse) of lists of surgery indices (in the order the nurse works them).

    The objective is to minimize the makespan (the maximum end time among all surgeries). Infeasible
    solutions are penalized heavily.
